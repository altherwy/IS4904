# Nullability in Dart

Dart introduced null safety as an optional setting in Dart 2.12, and it is required in Dart 3. With null safety, values canâ€™t be null unless you say they can be. This makes it easier to avoid null reference errors and improve code reliability.

## Nullable and Non-nullable Types

With null safety, all types default to non-nullable. For example, if you have a variable of type `String`, it always contains a string. To allow a variable of type `String` to accept any string or the value `null`, add a question mark (`?`) after the type name. This changes the type of variable to a nullable type. For example, a variable of type `String?` can contain a string or it can be `null`.

```dart
String? carName; // initialized to null by default
int? marks = 36; // initialized to non-null
marks = null; // can be re-assigned to null
```
## Null-aware Operators

Null-aware operators are used to handle nullable values more efficiently and safely.

### Null-coalescing Operators (?? and ??=)

The null-coalescing operator (`??`) allows you to provide a default value when an expression is `null`,

```dart
String? name;
String fullName = name ?? 'John Doe'; // returns 'John Doe' if name is null
```
or, you can use ??= to update the same variable,
```dart
int? fontSize;
fontSize ??= 12;
```

### Null Assertion Operator (!)

If youâ€™re sure an expression with a nullable type doesnâ€™t equal `null`, you can use the null assertion operator (`!`) to make Dart treat it as non-nullable. By adding `!` after the expression, you assert two conditions to Dart about the expression:

1. Its value doesnâ€™t equal `null`.
2. Dart can assign the value to a non-nullable variable.

If the expression does equal `null`, Dart throws an exception at run-time. This makes the `!` operator unsafe. Donâ€™t use it unless you have no doubt the expression canâ€™t equal `null`.

```dart
String? name = 'John';
String fullName = name! + ' Doe'; // throws an exception if name is null
```



### Conditional Property Access (?.)

The conditional property access operator (`?.`) allows you to access properties and methods of an object only if that object is not `null`. If the object is `null`, the entire expression evaluates to `null`.

```dart
int? age;
print(age?.isNegative); // do not crash when age is null, instead it returns null
```
### Late Keyword

The `late` keyword is used to declare variables that will be initialized later in the code. These variables are called non-nullable variables as they are initialized after the declarationÂ². Once a non-nullable variable is declared with the `late` keyword, it cannot be null at runtime.

Here is an example of using the `late` keyword:

```dart
late String name;

void main() {
  name = 'John Doe';
  print(name); // Output: John Doe
}
```

In the above example, the variable `name` is declared with the `late` keyword. It is initialized later in the `main()` function. When we print the value of `name`, it outputs "John Doe" because it has been assigned a valueÂ³.

The `late` keyword is useful when you don't know the initial value of a variable, but you assure Dart that you will initialize it before using itÂ³. It helps prevent null reference errors and improves code reliability.

## Conclusion

Null safety in Dart makes it easier to write reliable code by preventing null reference errors. By using nullable and non-nullable types, null assertion operators, and null-aware operators, you can handle nullable values more efficiently and safely.

Happy coding! ðŸš€
