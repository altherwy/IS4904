# Constructors in Dart

## Code Description

This code demonstrates the usage of the `User` class and its various constructors.


```dart
void main() {
  User youssef = const User(name:'Youssef', id:33);
  User anonymous = const User.anonymous();
  print(youssef);
  print(anonymous);
}

class User {
  final String name;
  final int id;

  // Default Constructor
  User();

  // Custom Constructor (Long Format)
  User(String name, int age){ 
    this.name = name; // shadowing
    this.age = age; // shadowing
  }

  // Custom Constructor (Short Format)
  User(this.name, this.id);
  
  // Named Constructor
  User.anonymous(){
    name = 'No Name';
    id = 101;
  }
  
  // Forwarding Constructor 
  const User.anonymous() : this(); 
  
  // Named Attributes in a Constructor
  const User({this.name = 'No Name', this.id = 101});
  
  @override
  String toString() {
    return 'My name is $name, and my ID is $id';
  }
}
```

## Explanation of Constructors


### Default Constructor

The default constructor is a constructor that takes no arguments. It is automatically generated by Dart if no other constructor is defined. In this code, we have defined a default constructor for the `User` class,
```dart
User();
```

### Custom Constructor (Long Format)

A custom constructor is a constructor that takes one or more arguments. It can be defined in two formats: long and short. The long format allows you to add additional logic to the constructor. In this code, we have defined a custom constructor in long format for the `User` class,

```dart
 User(String name, int age){ 
    this.name = name; // shadowing
    this.age = age; // shadowing
  }
```

### Custom Constructor (Short Format)

The short format of a custom constructor allows you to define a constructor with one line of code. In this code, we have defined a custom constructor in short format for the `User` class,
```dart
User(this.name,this.id);
```

### Named Constructor

A named constructor is a constructor that has a name other than the class name. In this code, we have defined a named constructor for the `User` class called `anonymous`,
```dart
User.anonymous(){
    name = 'No Name';
    id = 101;
}
```

### Forwarding Constructor

A forwarding constructor is a constructor that calls another constructor in the same class. In this code, we have defined three forwarding constructors for the `User` class,
```dart
User.anonymous():this('No Name',101);
```

### Named Attributes in a Constructor

Named attributes in a constructor allow you to specify default values for parameters. In this code, we have defined named attributes in a constructor for the `User` class,

```dart
User({this.name = 'No Name', this.id = 101});
```

## Usage

To run the code, follow these steps:

1. Install **Dart SDK** on your machine.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory where the code file is located.
4. Run the following command:

```bash
dart <filename>.dart
```

Replace `<filename>` with the actual name of your Dart file.

## Output

The expected output of the code is as follows:

```
My name is Youssef, and my ID is 33
My name is No Name, and my ID is 101
```

Happy coding! ðŸš€
